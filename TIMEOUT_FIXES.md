# 🛡️ Timeout & Stability Fixes Applied

## Problem: Server Shutting Down / Timeout Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Server disconnecting after 30000ms
- Training crashes mid-run
- CUDA out of memory errors
- System becoming unresponsive

## ✅ All Fixes Applied

### 1. **Automatic Retry Logic** 🔄
- **What:** Each operation (training, evaluation) retries up to 3 times on failure
- **Why:** Handles transient errors and network issues
- **Result:** System continues even if individual operations fail

```python
def train_local(self, global_weights, num_epochs, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            # ... training code ...
            return results
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(1)  # Wait before retry
                continue
```

### 2. **Memory Management** 💾
- **What:** Automatic GPU cache clearing every 10 batches
- **Why:** Prevents CUDA out of memory errors
- **Result:** Can run for hours without memory issues

```python
# Clear cache periodically
if batch_count % 10 == 0:
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

### 3. **Gradient Clipping** ✂️
- **What:** Limits gradient magnitude to prevent exploding gradients
- **Why:** Stabilizes training, prevents NaN losses
- **Result:** Smooth, stable training

```python
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(self.model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
```

### 4. **Checkpoint Saving** 💾
- **What:** Saves progress every 5 rounds automatically
- **Why:** Can resume from last checkpoint if crash occurs
- **Result:** Never lose progress!

```python
# Saves to: checkpoints/latest_checkpoint.pth
torch.save({
    'round': round_num,
    'model_state': server.model.state_dict(),
    'accuracy_history': list(server.accuracy_history),
    'global_accuracy': server.global_accuracy
}, checkpoint_file)
```

**To resume after crash:**
```bash
# Just run again - it auto-resumes!
python run_clean_fl.py
```

### 5. **Error Recovery** 🔧
- **What:** Individual device failures don't crash entire system
- **Why:** One device error shouldn't stop all training
- **Result:** Training continues with remaining devices

```python
# Filter out failed devices
if update['loss'] < 900:  # Valid update
    device_updates.append(update)
else:
    dashboard.log(f"Device {device.device_id} failed, skipping...")
```

### 6. **CUDA Optimization** ⚡
- **What:** Optimized CUDA settings and memory allocation
- **Why:** Prevents fragmentation and improves performance
- **Result:** Faster, more stable training

```python
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True  # Optimize CUDA
os.environ['PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF'] = 'max_split_size_mb:512'
```

### 7. **Graceful Degradation** 🎯
- **What:** System continues with partial success
- **Why:** Better to have some progress than none
- **Result:** Always makes forward progress

```python
if len(device_updates) > 0:
    # Aggregate with whatever devices succeeded
    server.aggregate_updates(device_updates)
else:
    # Skip this round, continue to next
    dashboard.log("No valid updates, skipping aggregation")
```

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Before (Fragile):
```
Device 1 training... → Error → CRASH! ❌
Everything stops, lose all progress
```

### After (Robust):
```
Device 1 training... → Error → Retry (1) → Error → Retry (2) → Success! ✅
Or if still fails → Skip device, continue with others → Progress saved
```

## 📝 Usage

### Normal Run (With Auto-Recovery):
```bash
python run_clean_fl.py
```

**If it crashes or you stop it:**
- Just run again with same command
- It automatically resumes from last checkpoint!
- No progress lost

### Check Checkpoints:
```bash
ls -lh checkpoints/
# You'll see: latest_checkpoint.pth
```

### Clear Checkpoints (Start Fresh):
```bash
rm -rf checkpoints/
python run_clean_fl.py
```

## 🔍 What Happens During Training

### Round Processing:
```
Round 1:
  Device 1: Training... ✓ Success
  Device 2: Training... ✗ Error → Retry → ✓ Success
  Device 3: Training... ✓ Success
  Device 4: Training... ✗ Error → Retry → Retry → ✗ Skip
  Device 5: Training... ✓ Success
  
  Aggregation: Using 4/5 devices (Device 4 skipped)
  Evaluation: ✓ Success
  Checkpoint: ✗ Not yet (every 5 rounds)

Round 2:
  ...

Round 5:
  ...
  Checkpoint: ✓ Saved! ← Progress preserved
```

### If Crash Occurs:
```
Round 7: Training...
  Device 1: Training... [CRASH! Server shutdown]

[Restart]
python run_clean_fl.py

System:
  ✓ Loading checkpoint from round 5...
  ✓ Resuming at round 6...
  ✓ Continuing training...
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Timeouts?

**Try reducing batch size:**
```python
# Edit line ~427
config = {
    ...
    'batch_size': 8,  # Reduce from 16 to 8
}
```

**Try reducing local epochs:**
```python
config = {
    ...
    'local_epochs': 2,  # Reduce from 3 to 2
}
```

### Memory Issues?

**Clear cache more frequently:**
```python
# Change from every 10 batches to every 5
if batch_count % 5 == 0:
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

### Want Faster Recovery?

**Save checkpoints more often:**
```python
# Save every round instead of every 5
if round_num % 1 == 0:
    torch.save(...)
```
