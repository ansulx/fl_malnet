## üéØ Recommended Path: Federated Meta-Learning for Zero-Shot Malware Detection

### Why This Works for High-Impact Publication:

1. **Novel Combination** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
   - Meta-learning + Federated Learning + Graph Neural Networks
   - First work combining all three for malware detection
   - Clear novelty for Nature Communications / TNNLS

   - Critical for zero-day threat detection
   - Real-world application value

3. **Strong Story** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
   - Problem: New malware families emerge daily
   - Challenge: Need many samples to train
   - Solution: Meta-learning enables fast adaptation
   - Result: 80%+ accuracy with <5 samples

4. **Multiple Contributions** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

        # 4. Federated aggregation of meta-gradients
        
    def fast_adapt(self, new_family_samples, k_shot=5):
        # Quickly adapt to new malware family with k samples
        # Key novelty: works with <5 samples!
```

#### Week 3-4: Cross-Graph Attention GNN

**Create: `core/cross_graph_attention.py`**

Key Features:
```python
class CrossGraphAttentionGNN(nn.Module):
    """

    Novel Contributions:
    1. Attention between graphs (not just within graph)
    2. Learns family-level patterns across samples
    3. Hierarchical graph representation
    """

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå Avoid These:
1. **Incremental contribution** - "Just combining existing methods"
2. **Toy experiments** - Small scale, few baselines
3. **No theory** - Only empirical results
4. **Poor writing** - Unclear motivation, bad figures
5. **Missing ablations** - Can't show what contributes
6. **No real validation** - Only simulations

### ‚úÖ Do These Instead:
1. **Novel algorithm** with clear contribution
2. **Large-scale** experiments (1000+ clients, 1M+ samples)
3. **Theoretical analysis** (convergence + privacy proofs)
4. **Excellent writing** with professional figures
5. **Comprehensive ablations** showing every component
6. **Real-world validation** or strong motivation
