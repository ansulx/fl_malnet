================================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

1. Initial Accuracy
   - First few rounds show low accuracy (20-30%)
   - This is normal for minimal training
   - Improves significantly with more rounds

2. Training Time
   - CPU training is slow (~70s per round)
   - GPU recommended for production use
   - Can be optimized with batch size tuning

3. Memory Usage
   - Large graphs (>2000 nodes) may cause OOM
   - Subsampling used to manage memory
   - Configurable max_nodes parameter

4. Dataset Size
   - Limited to 5,000 samples per split
   - May not be representative of all malware
   - Sufficient for research/demonstration

5. Privacy-Utility Tradeoff
   - Privacy (ε=1.0) reduces accuracy by ~5-10%
   - This is expected in differential privacy
   - Configurable epsilon for tuning

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For Quick Testing:
  1. Run verify_complete_project.py first
  2. Run test_integration.py (2-3 minutes)
  3. Check results in console output

For Initial Experiments:
  1. Use config defaults (10 rounds, 3 clients)
  2. Run on CPU for stability
  3. Monitor results/training.log
  4. Expected time: 15-20 minutes

For Research-Grade Results:
  1. Edit config: 50 rounds, 10 epochs, 10 clients
  2. Use GPU if available (device: "cuda")
  3. Enable mixed precision for speed
  4. Expected time: 30-60 minutes (GPU)

For Privacy Research:
  1. Try different epsilon values (0.5, 1.0, 2.0)
  2. Compare accuracy vs. privacy
  3. Monitor privacy budget
  4. Use secure aggregation

For Non-IID Research:
  1. Try split_strategy: "dirichlet"
  2. Vary alpha (0.1 = very non-IID, 1.0 = less non-IID)
  3. Analyze client data distributions
  4. Compare with IID baseline

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
================================================================================

If you encounter issues:

1. Out of Memory:
   - Reduce batch_size to 2 or 4
   - Reduce max_nodes to 1000 or 500
   - Use CPU instead of GPU
   - Reduce num_clients

2. Slow Training:
   - Use GPU (device: "cuda")
   - Reduce num_rounds
   - Reduce local_epochs
   - Increase batch_size (if memory allows)

3. Low Accuracy:
   - Increase num_rounds (try 50)
   - Increase local_epochs (try 10)
   - Try different model types (gat)
   - Adjust learning rate

4. NaN Loss:
   - Reduce learning rate (try 0.0001)
   - Check data quality
   - Disable privacy temporarily
   - Reduce max_nodes

5. Import Errors:
   - Run: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Check Python version (3.8+)
   - Verify PyTorch and PyG versions
