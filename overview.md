## Research Problem & Motivation

### Problem Statement
Traditional centralized malware detection systems require sharing sensitive malware samples and user data, creating significant privacy and security risks. Current approaches face challenges in:
- **Data Privacy**: Sharing malware samples violates user privacy and organizational security policies

### Research Motivation
Federated learning offers a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training without data sharing. However, applying FL to malware detection presents unique challenges:
- **Non-IID Data Distribution**: Malware patterns vary significantly across organizations and regions
- **Privacy Requirements**: Strong privacy guarantees are essential for sensitive cybersecurity data

### Technical Approach

**Image-Based Malware Representation**
We convert malware binaries into grayscale images, where each pixel represents a byte from the binary file. This approach captures structural patterns in malware while enabling the use of proven CNN architectures. The image representation provides several advantages:
- **Pattern Recognition**: CNNs excel at identifying visual patterns in malware structure
- **Standardization**: Consistent input format across different malware types
- **Privacy Preservation**: Images can be processed with privacy-preserving techniques
- **Scalability**: Efficient processing and communication of image data

**Federated Learning Framework**
Our federated learning approach implements a client-server architecture where:
- **Clients**: Individual devices/organizations train local models on private malware data
- **Server**: Aggregates model updates to create a global malware detection model
- **Communication**: Only model parameters are shared, never raw data
- **Privacy**: Differential privacy mechanisms protect individual contributions

**Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms**
We implement differential privacy to provide formal privacy guarantees:
- **Noise Addition**: Calibrated Gaussian noise added to model updates
- **Gradient Clipping**: Bounded sensitivity for privacy analysis
- **Privacy Accounting**: Real-time tracking of privacy budget consumption
- **Secure Aggregation**: Cryptographic protocols for Byzantine-robust training

### Experimental Design

**Dataset Selection & Rationale**
We utilize the MalNet dataset, which contains 87,430 malware samples across 246 families, providing a comprehensive and realistic evaluation environment. The dataset's diversity in malware types and families enables thorough testing of our federated learning approach under various scenarios. We employ non-IID data distribution using Dirichlet distribution (α=0.5) to simulate realistic federated learning conditions where different clients have varying malware exposure patterns.

**Model Architecture Selection**
Our approach employs ResNet18 as the primary architecture due to its proven effectiveness in image classification tasks and its ability to capture hierarchical features in malware images. The choice of CNN architecture is motivated by the visual nature of malware patterns when represented as images, where structural similarities and differences become apparent through convolutional feature extraction.

**Federated Learning Protocol**
The federated learning protocol follows a standard client-server architecture with multiple aggregation strategies to ensure robustness. We implement FedAvg as the baseline aggregation method, with additional strategies including WeightedFedAvg for handling heterogeneous data distributions, FedMedian for Byzantine robustness, and Krum for outlier detection and mitigation.

**Privacy-Privacy Trade-off Analysis**
Our experimental design systematically evaluates the trade-off between privacy preservation and model utility. We vary the privacy budget (ε) from 0.1 to 2.0 to analyze the impact on detection accuracy, convergence speed, and overall system performance. This analysis provides insights into optimal privacy parameters for different deployment scenarios.
